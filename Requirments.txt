Step 1: Open Registry Editor as Admin

Press Win + S → type regedit

Right-click Registry Editor → select Run as administrator

Running as admin is required to access HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

Step 2: Navigate Carefully

In Registry Editor, expand the keys in this order:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  └─ SYSTEM
      └─ CurrentControlSet
          └─ Control
              └─ FileSystem

Click each folder (triangle/arrow) to expand.

Don’t type manually in the search box; the search box doesn’t always work for nested keys.

Step 3: Add or Edit LongPathsEnabled

Look for LongPathsEnabled in the right pane.

If it exists, double-click it → set Value = 1 → click OK

If it does not exist, right-click → New → DWORD (32-bit) Value

Name it: LongPathsEnabled

Double-click it → set Value = 1 → OK

Step 4: Restart Windows

Changes only take effect after a restart.
